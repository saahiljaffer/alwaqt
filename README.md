# Hijri Calendar

## How does this work?

This repository contains a custom dayjs plugin that uses a preferred moonsighting method to calculate the Hijri date. The plugin works by calculating Hijri dates to Julian days and then converting them to Gregorian dates. The plugin also includes a method to convert Gregorian dates to Hijri dates (by performing the reverse operation).
